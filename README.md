## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:khurramaleee/game-database.git
cd game-database
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Get your API Key

- Sign up for a free API key at [rawg.io/apikey](https://rawg.io/apikey).  
- Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.  
- Add your API key to it (Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix):

```env
VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 4. Update the API Client

Modify `src/services/api-client.tsx` to use your environment variable instead of a hard-coded key:

```tsx
export default axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.rawg.io/api",
  params: {
    key: import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY, // Use the environment variable
  },
});
```

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
